# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple game where players choose one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. In Python, you can implement it using random choices for the computer and input for the player. The winner is determined based on the rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.
